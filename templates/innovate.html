					<p class="subDetails">Human life is fast evolving, with multiple avenues for development and the growth. Our busy lives have reduced time for leisure and entertainment. Movies are an easy medium to take your mind off troubles and relax. However, people are often confused about what they ought to watch. </p>
					<br>
					<p class="subDetails"><b><u>The Current Outlook-:</u></b>
More often than not, it is believed that viewers will be likely to choose movies with high ratings and we assume they will pick those. 
<br>
<br><b><u>Fact-:</b></u>There is however no conclusive evidence that ratings will determine whether more viewers will choose to watch a movie.
<br>
<br><b><u>Reason-:</b></u> This is because people hink differently, have different interests and therefore like different actors, storyline and genres. A rating does not alone inspire a viewer to make a selection. Their moods and tastes also play a role.
<br>
<br><b><u>Observation-:</u></b> Often people just remember names of a few of their favourite movies and can’t make a selection. They are happy to be spoilt for choice and promoted by an intelligent source for guidance in line with their tastes. 
<br>
<br><b><u>Conclusion-:</u></b> Here’s when , Ingenious Entertainment Advisor steps in to solve this problem by using it’s artificial intelligence to recommend the best movie for us by considering some specifications given by a viewer.
